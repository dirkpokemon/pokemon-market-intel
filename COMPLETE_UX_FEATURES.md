## 📊 **Technical Architecture**

### **State Management:**
- **React useState** for local component state
- **localStorage** for watchlist persistence
- **Context API** for Toast notifications
- **Props** for component communication

### **Data Flow:**
1. Dashboard loads → Fetch from API
2. User filters → `useMemo` recalculates filtered deals
3. User sorts → Array sort in-place
4. User paginates → Slice filtered array
5. User clicks deal → Open modal with deal data
6. User clicks "Buy Now" → Construct URL, open in new tab

### **Performance:**
- **Memoization**: `useMemo` for filtered deals (recalculates only when deps change)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Charts load only client-side (`ssr: false`)
- **Skeleton Loaders**: Instant UI, data loads async
- **Debouncing**: Search updates instantly (no debounce needed with memoization)

---

## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### **Changing Deal Modal Buy Links:**
Edit `services/frontend/src/components/DealModal.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line 79-90 (mock listings)
const mockListings = [
  {
    source: 'CardMarket',
    url: `https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Pokemon/Products/Singles/${encodeURIComponent(deal.product_set || 'Unknown')}/${encodeURIComponent(deal.product_name)}`
  }
];
```

**In Production:**
- Fetch real listings from `raw_prices` table by `product_id`
- Use `source` + `source_id` fields to construct URLs
- Example query:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM raw_prices 
  WHERE card_id = $product_id 
  ORDER BY price ASC 
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

### **Changing Pagination Size:**
Edit `dashboard/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line 39
const dealsPerPage = 12; // Change to 24, 36, etc.
```

### **Changing Toast Duration:**
Edit `ToastContainer.tsx`:

```typescript
// Line 14
const showToast = (message: string, type: ToastType = 'info', duration = 3000) // Change 3000 to 5000, etc.
```
